Vulnerabilities, exploits and threats information are collected from various OSINT feeds.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"subtitle-1\">Monitoring</p>\n      <p class=\"body-2\">\n        Vendors, products, packages and vulnerabilities could be monitored. New data or changes are then identified and reported to users. Be careful when enabling/disabling monitoring on a vendor. Monitoring will be enabled/disabled on all related products, regardless of previous monitoring status.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"subtitle-1\">Organizations</p>\n      <p class=\"body-2\">\n        An organization (or \"Team\") is a group of users sharing lists of monitored vendors, products, packages or vulnerabilities. An user could be member of several organizations. An user is able to add and edit exploits or threats references. These submissions remain private within the context of the organization.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"subtitle-1\">Alerting</p>\n      <p class=\"body-2\">\n        Alerts could be sent on key events like changes in monitored assets or periodic reporting.\n        Several notification systems could be enabled depending of your configuration, including email, Slack and Feedly.
